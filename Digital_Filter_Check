#Automatic Digital Filter Check for quantization noise using Den's Code to check Digital Filter Noise

The automatic_digital_check script which can check all digital filters given the filter file name has been pushed to 

[GitHub Repository for the above code] http://github.com/ayush9pandey/quantization/

A new git repo has been used because I have forked it from Den's repo and have been working on controls@nodus, so couldn't push to the current repo.
