The folder consists of .tex files and other supporting files which constitute the Project Report for the project titled:
**Quantization Noise in Digital Control Systems**. 

The image folder consists of the .jpeg files used for diagrams in the report.

***
Some Issues:
 1. There should be a table of contents in the report.
 1. Use vector graphics (like SVG or PDF)
 1. I think the ADC quantization operation is not actually 'round' but instead something like 'floor'. Is this true?
 1. Please give us a calculation which recovers the classic expression for the quantization noise of an ADC. i.e. proportional to 1/sqrt(12 *f_sample)
 1. Then we want to have a numerical (matlab) simulation which reproduces the same noise spectrum to make sure that we are doing this OK.
 2. Then we want to change the characteristics of the dither noise to change the shape of the digitized noise.
