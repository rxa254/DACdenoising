The folder consists of .tex files and other supporting files which constitute the Project Report for the project titled:
**Quantization Noise in Digital Control Systems**. 

The image folder consists of the .jpeg files used for diagrams in the report. 

Some Issues:
1. There should be a table of contents in the report.
1. Use vector graphics (like SVG or PDF)
1. I think the ADC quantization operation is not actually 'round' but instead something like 'floor'. Is this true?
1. Please give us a calculation which recovers the classic expression for the quantization noise of an ADC. i.e. proportional to 1/sqrt(12 *f_sample)

This is the Acknowledgement for all the issues you have raised! I'll come up with the changes and additions asap.

Added to that, I have completed the following: (which I'll be pushing in together, after I make the changes and additions mentioned above)

1. ADC Noise Shaping Derivations 
2. Simlation in Simulink for Sigma Delta architecture design of an ADC
3. Frequency Spectrum for the same (of the error, noise shaped)
4. LaTeX document covering all the above.
