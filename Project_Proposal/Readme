The folder consists of .tex files and other supporting files which constitute the Project Report for the project titled:
**Quantization Noise in Digital Control Systems**. 

The image folder consists of the .jpeg files used for diagrams in the report. 

Some Issues:
1. There should be a table of contents in the report.
1. Use vector graphics (like SVG or PDF)
1. I think the ADC quantization operation is not actually 'round' but instead something like 'floor'. Is this true?
1. Please give us a calculation which recovers the classic expression for the quantization noise of an ADC. i.e. proportional to 1/sqrt(12 *f_sample)
